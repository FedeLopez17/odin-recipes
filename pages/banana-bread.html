        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas. 
            It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads.<br>
            Banana bread recipes began being featured in well-known cookbooks across North America as baking soda and baking powder were being mass produced and becoming available in grocery stores in the 1930s. 
            It appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook, and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book in 1950.

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. 
                Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.

            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. 
                Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.
