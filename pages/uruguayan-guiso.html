        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The Uruguayan Guiso is a kind of stew popular in Uruguay. It's made of beef chucks, chorizo sausages, a variety of vegetables, and Ditalini pasta.<br>
            Given the fact that Uruguay is geographically located within the southern cone, temperatures are usually low. Therefore, most of Uruguayan typical dishes not only have 
            ingredients of the region, but also possess a high caloric content, optimal for the winter months.<br>
            The Uruguayan Guiso in particular is one of the most common dishes, mainly due to its low cost and straightforward preparation.

            <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cube vegetable bouillon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>2 cups ditalini pasta</li>
            <li>1 cups frozen peas, thawed</li>
            <li>1 cups cooked lentils</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat.
                Cook, turning occasionally and pricking each link with a fork to release some of the fat, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes.
                Remove sausages and slice when cool enough to handle. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Add beef and cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Add reserved sausage slices, onion, leek, and garlic and saute until onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in butternut squash, potatoes, and carrots. Add water and tomato sauce. 
                If vegetables are not covered with liquid, add more water to cover.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add bouillon cube, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper and bring to boil. 
                Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring occasionally, until stew thickens up, about 1 hour. 
                Add pasta, peas, lentils, and parsley. Cook until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. 
                You may need to add more water at this point, since the pasta will absorb liquid and the stew may become too dry.
